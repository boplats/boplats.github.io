## Boplats: introduction to housing in Göteborg

Boplats is a revolutionary website that has developed over time due to the dire need brought about by difficulty in finding and accessing both regular and student apartments. 

With that in mind, Boplats found a brilliant way of pooling what was necessary to avail housing for those who needed it. The site provides the users an opportunity to search for apartments offered by different property owners (landlords). The property owners have been brought together providing their vacant apartments on Boplats. 

From the Boplats site, one has a variety to choose from, with all an individual’s preferences considered. The site is used for both students and regulars.
