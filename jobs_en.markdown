## <a id="introductory_task"></a>Introductory task.
At Skanatek we believe that well-organized software processess are a big part of success. It is equally important to code well, to test the code and to document the code. It is also important for a software development team to collaborate smoothly via versioning systems and an issue tracker.

Therefore, the introductory task consists of smaller sub-tasks which are not just coding. In addition, the introductory task tests how well an applicant can learn and adapt to new technologies:

- Register at our [issue tracker](http://redmine.platformable.net).
- [Read](http://redmine.platformable.net/projects/community/wiki) and understand the software processes that we use.
- Decide which Python program you will create. It can be a small and simple command line [program](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html). You can write anything! Your program can request some page and then print out the encoding of the page. The only requirement for the program is only that it should use the [requests Python library](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) in some way and the [virtualenv Python library](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/). The requirements.txt file which is already in the repository is to be used by the virtualenv library.
- [Create](http://redmine.platformable.net/projects/new) a project for your task. You can call it whatever.
- Create an issue in your new project. The issue should describe what kind of program you are going to write.
- [Pull](http://git-scm.com/book) from the [repository](http://redmine.platformable.net/projects/community/wiki/How_to_use_git_with_Redmine).
- Write the [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) so, that [coverage](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/) reports 80-100% coverage of your custom written code.
- Write your program.
- Document the program according to [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and create a simple README file which explains how to run the program.
- Push the code to the repository.
- Resolve the issue and report that in the issue tracker.
- Once you are done with the previous step, we will be notified by the issue tracker. We will run you small program according to your README file and *then* we will contact you.
