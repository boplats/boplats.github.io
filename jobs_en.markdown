[Write your thesis at our company](#thesis)

[Introductory task](#introductory_task)




## <a id="internship"></a> Internship: Software developer

*The internship is powered by the [Arbetspraktik program](http://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/download/18.46ccfec5127ddccec778000492/) of the Swedish Labour Agency. You need to be registered as unemployed at [Arbetsförmedlingen](http://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/) to apply for this type of support.*

### What you will learn:

- industry-grade coding: server maintenance automation (Python, Fabric, Ruby);
- agile practices in software development;
- software processes for development, implementation and deployment of UNIX-based remote networked services.

### What you will NOT learn:

- how to parse Twitter's feeds;
- how to write an app for Facebook;
- how to create a game for iPhone.

### Terms and conditions:
- 3-6 months internship (Arbetspraktik);
- Full-time schedule;
- ~4400 SEK monthly internship payment (paid by the Arbetspraktik support program).

### Position advantages:
- Remote position (no need to visit the office). You are free to work at home with your laptop as long as you do your daily reports (tasks completed, time spent, time estimated);
- Hands-on experience. You will get tasks which are directly related to implementing software for our clients;
- Informal and flexible atmosphere. Do you have a suit? Good, you do not need one at this position;
- Your voice can be heard. The more experience you will accumulate over time, the more freedom in decision making you will get.

### Requirements:
- You should be registered as unemployed at Arbetsförmedlingen (Swedish Employment Agency);
- The only skill requirement is your ability to learn new technologies and implement them in your work;
- Optional: Python, Ruby, Linux shell, Fabric, UNIX administration.

#### To apply for the internship you must complete the [Introductory task](#introductory_task) first.


## <a id="thesis"></a> Thesis: various research topics

Dear student, we are pleased to inform you that now you can write your thesis (Bachelor or Master) with Skanatek AB. We have a few research topics under development, some of which are:

- Development Operations support (DevOps) as a code (with Chef OpsCode);
- Software Development in fully distributed teams;
- Augmented Reality on PC and embedded hardware.

#### To apply for the thesis collaboration you must complete the [Introductory task](#introductory_task) first.

## <a id="introductory_task"></a>Introductory task.
At Skanatek we believe that well-organized software processess are a big part of success. It is equally important to code well, to test the code and to document the code. It is also important for a software development team to collaborate smoothly via versioning systems and an issue tracker.

Therefore, the introductory task consists of smaller sub-tasks which are not just coding. In addition, the introductory task tests how well an applicant can learn and adapt to new technologies:

- Register at our [issue tracker](http://redmine.platformable.net).
- [Read](http://redmine.platformable.net/projects/community/wiki) and understand the software processes that we use.
- Decide which Python program you will create. It can be a small and simple command line [program](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html). You can write anything! Your program can request some page and then print out the encoding of the page. The only requirement for the program is only that it should use the [requests Python library](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) in some way and the [virtualenv Python library](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/). The requirements.txt file which is already in the repository is to be used by the virtualenv library.
- [Create](http://redmine.platformable.net/projects/new) a project for your task. You can call it whatever.
- Create an issue in your new project. The issue should describe what kind of program you are going to write.
- [Pull](http://git-scm.com/book) from the [repository](http://redmine.platformable.net/projects/community/wiki/How_to_use_git_with_Redmine).
- Write the [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) so, that [coverage](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/) reports 80-100% coverage of your custom written code.
- Write your program.
- Document the program according to [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and create a simple README file which explains how to run the program.
- Push the code to the repository.
- Resolve the issue and report that in the issue tracker.
- Once you are done with the previous step, we will be notified by the issue tracker. We will run you small program according to your README file and *then* we will contact you.
