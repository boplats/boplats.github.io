## Boplats hints and tips

- Always keep your details up to date – the registration details that you provided at Boplats during registration is what the landlords will use to invite for viewing, so, always keep them up to date.
- Be sure your preferences are matching – it is crucial to ensure that your preferences are as close to the landlords as possible because that is the only way you can be sure of being invited for a view.
- Check for deadline – every application for the apartment has a deadline while the invites from the landlords have a reply date so that you do not miss out.
- Adverts – there is a special section dedicated for adverts, this for the international students. In addition, in this section you can have a chance of subletting the rooms availed in the adverts.
- Student apartments – it is easier to get student apartments as compared to regular apartments.
